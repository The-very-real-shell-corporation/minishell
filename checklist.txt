Your shell should:

👍	• Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
👍	• Have a working history.
👍	• Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
	• Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal. 

👍	• Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).

	• Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
	• Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).

	• Implement redirections:
		◦ < should redirect input.
		◦ > should redirect output.
		◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
		delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
		◦ >> should redirect output in append mode.

	• Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
	connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
👍	• Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
	should expand to their values.
	• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
	foreground pipeline.

	• Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
	• In interactive mode:
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

	• Your shell must implement the following builtins:
	◦ echo with option -n
	◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
	◦ pwd with no options
	◦ export with no options
	◦ unset with no options
	◦ env with no options or arguments
	◦ exit with no options
